My passion for technology started when I received my first computer, a Commodore 64, as a child. That experience opened up a whole new world for me, and I've been fascinated by computers ever since.

Nowadays, I have a strong interest in Linux, FreeBSD, and everything open source. I believe in the power of open-source projects and the amazing communities behind them. It's inspiring to see how people collaborate online to create and share tools that anyone can use.

On this site, I share my ideas, projects, and different topics that interest me. I'm constantly learning and look forward to connecting with others who share my passions.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something that interests you!
